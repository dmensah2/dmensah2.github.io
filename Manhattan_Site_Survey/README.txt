Name: Manhattan Site Survey

This web app is intended for use by legacy RKF administrators to create maps for usage in site surveys.

It was created using the ESRI JavaScript API.

The editor widget is meant for the admins to make edits to retail data. It will also eventually be the same layer that
the canvassers use in the ArcGIS for Collector app to make edits.

It contains the legacy RKF streetmap layer originally stored in MapInfo, moved to SQL Server
and is now uploaded as a layer to our organziation at the following URL.

The zoning layer is pulled from MapPluto.

Both layers have been made sharable with the entire organization:

*MapPluto - https://ngkf125.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=480e860b6fc74dd48be454b75e4b3046
*Retail - https://ngkf125.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=18258bf7761349eca967fed9d5663c55
